Introduction
============
This implements a client-server Mazewar game. 
Additionally, the MSocket class can be used to 
induce errors, such as adding delays and reordering packets.


Architecture
============
The server starts and listens on some port.

When a client contacts the server, the server spawns a 
ServerListenerThread. Server.java defines the MAX_CLIENTS constant 
that determines the maximum number of clients that join.

When the expected number of clients have contacted the 
server, the server spawns a single ServerSenderThreads, that broadcasts 
the name and location of all the clients (this requires that names
must be unique).

When an event happens, it is sent to the server. The server
stamps the event with a global sequence number and broadcasts to all 
hosts.

The client and server communicates using MSockets, and MServerSockets
which are analogous to Sockets and ServerSockets. MSockets are 
constructed by passing a host address and port. MSockets expose two 
main methods, readObject and writeObject to read and write objects, respectively. 

The MSocket can reorder packets and add delays based on 
3 constants defined in MSocket.java, namely DELAY_WEIGHT, DELAY_THRESHOLD, 
UNORDER_FACTOR. Errors are added both on sending and receiveing packets.


Making and Running
==================
To make the project run
make

To run the Naming Service:
./naming_server.sh <naming port> <total player>
  Example: ./naming_server.sh 8000 3


To run the clients: 
./run.sh <naming host> <naming port> <my address> <my port>
  Example: ./run.sh ug232.eecg.utoronto.ca 8000 ug232.eecg.utoronto.ca 8002
